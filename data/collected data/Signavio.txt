HOSPITAL PROCESS
A hospital wants to establish a rating workflow for their doctors. To make the workflow reliable two different roles are assigned. The first one is a referee from the newly created quality assurance department while the second one represents the managing director of the hospital. Both roles execute all of
their tasks independently from each other.
The referee starts a new case regarding a certain doctor by interviewing patients. Since a patient interview workflow is already established, it is simply integrated in the new workflow. Meanwhile, the director asks an external expert to review the work of the doctor under rating. Unfortunately, since the expert only gets a low expenses fee, it can happen that the expert is not responding in time. If that
happens, another expert has to be asked (who could also not respond in time, i.e. the procedure repeats). If an expert finally sends an expertise, it is received by the director and forwarded to the referee.
The referee files the results containing the patient interviews as well as the expertise and afterward
creates a report. While the referee is doing this, the manager fills a check to pay the expenses of the expert.

LOAN PROCESS
A sales force agent calls her insurance headquarters for issuing a loan request for a customer. She talks
to one out of fourteen employees sitting around a conference table, who writes down the request on a
piece of paper. Another employee takes this paper one floor up to the loan department, where a specialist types in the information into a computer system and checks the liability of the customer. This expert writes down the results of the liability check and hands it over to the next link in the chain: the contracting department.
This department is responsible for customizing the standard loan contract for the customer. The department uses its own computer system. After having finished this work, an employee staples together
the request form with the special conditions.
As a next step, a clerk responsible for pricing enters the information into his spreadsheet software and
calculates which interest rate applies to the customer. She notes this rate on a sheet of paper and hands
it on together with the material from the other departments.
Finally, a clerk creates a proposal and sends it back to the sales force agent via Federal Express.

CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
After an accident has occurred, the beneficiary calls an insurance agent who in turn contacts the insurance company. It can take up to three days until the notification of claim is entered and a qualified clerk
is assigned the case.
The clerk checks whether the beneficiary’s policy was valid at the time of the accident. If not, the
process terminates here. The next steps basically try to answer two questions: Whose insurance is obliged to pay and how much is it going to cost?
For estimating the cost, the regulator talks to the doctors and injured parties about the injuries caused
by the accident and how they need to be treated. Then, she comes up with a quote for the car repairs.
This requires a lot of phone calls. For answering the question about who is to blame for the accident, the
regulator calls the beneficiary, other injured persons, witnesses and the police. Furthermore, she is likely
to drop by the people involved and the place of accident.
Estimating the costs for repairs and doctors is influenced by many variables: Which repair is really
needed? Is it required to order original spare parts from the manufacturer or can parts produced by
other companies also be used? Which medical treatment is sufficient?
None of these questions is easy to answer. Typically, it takes 35 days until the clerk has gathered enough
information before she can decide whether or not to pay compensation and if so how much.
If all parties are satisfied with the compensation, the file can be closed. In average this happens after 40
days in total. However, if legal measures are initiated, the process might take considerably longer. A
lawsuit easily consumes 5 years.
Considering all claims, the insurance pays 3,500€ as compensation for physical damage and personal injury. Internal costs sum up to 500€ as an average.

HOTEL SERVICE
The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian,
the room-service manager takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food. She also gives an order to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch wine
from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. Finally, she assigns the order to the waiter. While the
kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a tablecloth on the
cart and gathers silverware). The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine,
and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guest’s room. After returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guest’s account. The waiter may wait to do the building if he has another order to prepare or deliver.

UNDERWRITERS
Whenever a company makes the decision to go public, its first task is to select the
underwriters. Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they
play a triple role: First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public.

Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new
issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to
handling the sale of a company’s issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of
approval to it.

They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they
need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state
that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is
awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a
road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance
from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm
commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public, when they haven’t still
found any reason not to do it.

INSURANCE PROCESS
Consider the following business process at an insurance company. The process includes two major roles,
agents (supporting customers outdoor) and clerks (work indoors). When the insurance company receives a new claim, the clerk calls the agent to actually check the claim, and creates a new case. As both
tasks are executed by different roles (that are mapped to different people), the activities are scheduled
in parallel. After the agent has confirmed the claim to the clerk, he supports the customer with additional assistance (e.g. getting a new id-card from the public authority). After the clerk has received the
confirmation from the agent, she issues a money order for the claim. If the agent has completed his additional support and the clerk has issued the money order, the claim is closed.

COMPUTER REPAIR
The workflow of a computer repair service (CRS) can be described as follows. A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer
home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is
detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished.

BICYCLE MANUFACTURING
A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order,
a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the
storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the
part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is
reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part
list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and
the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the
sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance.

CATERING SERVICE
Design the processes for a client who wants to establish an online catering service. The service should
be available over the Internet and provide the options to create or change customer profiles, choose
and remove goods from a shopping cart, as well as a checkout. The goods are divided into two types:
cold and warm. All cold goods are simply taken from the storehouse, whereas warm goods are prepared
half an hour before the delivery starts. After the customer has chosen several gold and warm goods, he
can proceed to the checkout. The checkout requires the selection of 1) a customer profile, 2) the delivery time, and 3) the credit card number, which is debited at the bank. Afterwards the order is saved
and the customer receives confirmation e-mail. The customer should be able to cancel orders at any
time until one hour before the delivery time. The catering service has to check open orders frequently to
prepare warm goods in time for delivery. After all cold and warm goods have been collected or prepared, they are delivered to the customer. The next day after the delivery an e-mail is send to the customer asking for feedback about the quality of the service and goods.

TRAVEL BOOKING
A travel agency wants to establish a booking service. The service is triggered by an incoming request and
can return two different messages, either an unavailable notification or a confirmation. The business
process of the service starts by first checking the request. If for certain reasons the request can only be
handled manually by an employee (e.g. group travels), a sub-process for manual handling is activated.
Otherwise, the process enters a transactional sub-process, where a bus and hotel booking occur in parallel. However, if one of these fails, the transaction is canceled, a log message is written and the unavailability message is sent. If both bookings succeed, an attraction is booked by invoking another service.
The only thing that could go wrong is a timeout; i.e. the attraction booking service is not responding in
time. If this happens, a manual handling of the booking has to be made. If the attraction booking invocation succeeds, a confirmation is sent. The manual handling always results in a successful booking in
which case a confirmation message is sent.

STUDENT PROJECT
End-of-study projects in an industrial environment are a mandatory part in the Bachelor curriculum. The
students are not yet involved in the planning phase, where each research group interacts with its industry partners. As the project proposals have to be handed in to the faculty by 30 June, the research group
starts planning in the beginning of June. The group sends request to all of its partners and waits for their
proposals for at most a week. The group selects the two most interesting proposals and starts planning
the details for these two proposals. First, the proposal is worked over in several iterations: The group
updates the proposal document, before it is sent to the partner who in turn updates it and sends it back.
Once the document has reached a final status, it is handed in to the faculty. The faculty decides which of
the proposals will be accepted. The outcome of this decision results in one of two messages: Either the
project proposal was rejected or it was accepted. In the latter case the group announces this positive
result to the corresponding partner.

LOAN BROKERAGE
An agency is brokering loans from two different credit institutes. A customer fills out a loan request containing the requested amount and his current monthly income. Afterwards he gets the loan proposal
with the lowest interest returned. Each financial institution has different rules for assigning loans. Bank
A assigns loans to everyone up to 20 times the month income but wants 20% interest a year. Bank B assigns loans to everyone with at least 2.000€ month income up to 100.000€. Loans equal or under
25.000€ are pre-checked by an external credit rating company (e.g. SCHUFA in Germany). Loans above
25.000€ additionally require a security which has to be checked directly with the customer. The interest
rates are 15% for loans under 25.000€, 12.5% for loans above 25.000€ with an adequate security, and
22.5% for loans without an adequate security.

ORDER MANAGEMENT
In an order management scenario a buyer places an order. A supplier receives the order which contains
a list of line item IDs and the cumulated price for the items. The supplier sends an order response for
every line item back to the buyer. The buyer has the chance to cancel his order until he has received all
responses. Once the supplier receives the cancellation notice, he can decide whether the cancellation is
valid or not. Therefore, he either acknowledges the cancellation or rejects it. If the order is processed
normally the buyer has to pay the amount he specified in the order, otherwise he has to pay a cancellation fee.
