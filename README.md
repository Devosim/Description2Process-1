This repository includes all data as well as source code of the paper "On the Applicability of Deep Learning to construct Process Models from Natural Text". 

The proposed methodology consists of an NLP pipeline that transforms a textual description into a process model in an XML format that is roughly based on BPMN. Textual inputs are limited to sequences of activities and 3 types of XOR splits.
